# Sequential pipeline (agents as pipeline stages)

**Industry name(s):** Sequential pipeline, prompt chain, agent-as-pipeline-stage, agentic chain
**Type:** Industry standard · Language-agnostic

> The primary topology in blooming insights: monitoring → diagnostic → recommendation, with the typed `Diagnosis` handed step-to-step as a structured message. The user gates the transition between stages. Each stage is a ReAct loop with its own tool subset and budget — but the order between them is fixed and owned by code.

## Why care

### Move 1 — the scenario (lead with the shape)

```
The sequential pipeline shape

  ┌─────────┐  draft  ┌─────────┐ reviewed ┌─────────┐
  │ Stage A │ ──────► │ Stage B │ ───────► │ Stage C │
  │ (find)  │         │(explain)│          │(propose)│
  └─────────┘         └─────────┘          └─────────┘

  output of one = input of next; order is fixed
```

You've written this code a thousand times:

```
const user = await fetchUser(id);
const orders = await loadOrders(user);
const summary = await summarize(orders);
return render(summary);
```

A `.then()` chain of single-purpose functions. Each step takes the previous step's output and produces the next step's input. The order is fixed (you can't summarize before you've loaded orders). The whole thing is a pipeline.

Now picture the same shape, except each function is an *agent* — a ReAct loop with its own prompt, its own tool subset, its own budget. The chain shape stays the same; the cells of the chain just got smarter inside.

### Move 2 — name the question

That second shape — a `.then()` chain where each function is an agent — is what sequential pipeline names. Not the diffing between agents, not the parallelism (there is none), just the order. The question this file answers: **when does it make sense to have agents as pipeline stages, versus one big agent that does everything, versus parallel workers?**

Sequential pipeline is the answer when the *sub-jobs are real* (different prompts, different tool needs, different output schemas) AND the *order is fixed* (each stage needs the previous one's output to start). Both halves matter.

### Move 3 — why answering that question matters

**Why you need to answer that question at all:** because the alternative shapes (one mega-agent, parallel fan-out) fail in opposite ways, and the failure cost is highest when you pick the wrong one.

One mega-agent with all tools fails by *responsibility-blending*: one prompt has to handle detection AND diagnosis AND recommendation; one tool budget has to cover all three; the model mixes outputs. Parallel fan-out fails when the sub-jobs aren't actually independent — if stage B needs stage A's diagnosis, running them in parallel just means B runs without context and you throw its work away.

In this codebase: the diagnostic agent's typed `Diagnosis` is literally an input to the recommendation agent's `propose(anomaly, diagnosis, hooks)` call. The recommendation agent cannot start without it. That data dependency is the constraint that forces sequential — not preference, not aesthetics. The order has to be sequential because the data flow is sequential.

### Move 4 — concrete before/after

One mega-agent with everything:
- One prompt, ~20 tools, one 12-iteration budget for detect + diagnose + recommend combined
- The model has to decide every turn: "am I detecting, diagnosing, or recommending?" — and the answer drifts
- Tool budget burned 8 turns on detection, only 4 left for diagnosis + recommendation
- Output schema is a soup — sometimes a diagnosis, sometimes a recommendation list, sometimes both, sometimes neither

Sequential pipeline (this codebase):
- Three prompts, each ~5–8 tools, each with its own budget (6/6/4 turns)
- Diagnostic agent runs with diagnostic prompt + diagnostic tools — no detection, no recommendation
- Diagnosis returned as typed `Diagnosis` object — a clean handoff
- Recommendation agent gets the diagnosis as an input; its prompt is focused on action proposals
- Each stage's output is schema-validated before becoming the next stage's input

### Move 5 — one-line summary

A sequential pipeline is a `.then()` chain where each function is an agent — same shape as `a().then(b).then(c)`, except `a` and `b` and `c` are ReAct loops. blooming insights uses this for `monitoring → diagnostic → recommendation`, with the typed `Diagnosis` as the message handed step-to-step. Here's how the mechanics work.

---

## How it works

**The mental model: a `.then()` chain where each link is an agent.** The order between links is owned by code (the route file's pipeline). What each link *does* — which tools, how many turns, when to stop — is owned by the model. Two layers of control, with the boundary cleanly drawn between them.

```
The sequential pipeline in this codebase

  monitoring             diagnostic              recommendation
  agent                  agent                   agent
  ┌──────────┐           ┌──────────┐            ┌──────────┐
  │ ReAct    │  Anomaly  │ ReAct    │ Diagnosis  │ ReAct    │
  │ loop     │ ────────► │ loop     │ ─────────► │ loop     │
  │ (6 tools)│ (typed)   │ (6 tools)│ (typed)    │ (4 tools)│
  └──────────┘           └──────────┘            └──────────┘
       ▲                      ▲                       ▲
       │                      │                       │
       └──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘
              CODE owns the order
              (app/api/agent/route.ts L224–L249)
              + (cross-request handoff via sessionStorage)
```

The strategy in plain English: **fix the order where you know it, isolate the work where you don't.** The order is fixed because the data flow is sequential (each stage's input is the previous stage's output). The work inside each stage is isolated because each stage has its own prompt, its own tool subset, and its own iteration budget.

### Isolate the kernel

A sequential pipeline of agents has an irreducible kernel: four pieces that make it a pipeline, not just calls in a row.

```
stage_N(input) → TypedMessage      ←  the shape is required
                      │
                      ▼  CARRIER (function arg | sessionStorage+URL)
                      │
stage_(N+1)(input, TypedMessage)   ←  consumes the typed value as input
                      │
                      ▼  per-stage isolation: own tools + own budget
                      │
                  next stage…       ←  CODE picks who runs next, not an LLM
```

Four load-bearing pieces:

1. **Typed inter-stage message** — a concrete schema (here: `Diagnosis` with `conclusion`, `evidence[]`, `hypothesesConsidered[]`, optional `affectedCustomers` / `confidence` / `timeSeries`, `lib/mcp/types.ts`). Stage N+1 takes it as a typed argument; the type system enforces that "stage N's output is a valid stage N+1 input."
2. **A handoff carrier** — *something* that moves the typed value from stage N to stage N+1. Two carriers ship in this repo: a function argument when stages run in the same request, a `sessionStorage`-write-plus-URL-param-read when they don't. Same message, two carriers.
3. **A gate that picks who runs next** — `app/api/agent/route.ts` reads `?step=diagnose|recommend` and picks the lead agent. Code, not an LLM. The Combined Run path makes this gate automatic ("after diagnose, recommend"); the Split Steps path makes it user-driven (the user clicks "see recommendations").
4. **Per-stage tool subset + budget** — each stage gets only the tools it needs (`lib/mcp/tools.ts`) and a budget calibrated to its job (monitoring 6, diagnostic 6, recommendation 4, query 6). The budget IS the per-stage isolation.

The wire-level mechanics — what the `Diagnosis` object looks like, how `sessionStorage['bi:diag:<id>']` is keyed, what `parseDiagnosis` validates, how the route's `if (step === 'diagnose')` ladder dispatches — are below. The kernel is what makes this a pipeline; everything else is hardening.

---

### Name each part by what breaks when removed

Each kernel piece is here because something specific breaks if you drop it.

```
Removed                            What breaks
────────────────────────────       ─────────────────────────────────────
typed message schema               Stages can only pass prose. The
                                   recommendation agent has to re-read
                                   the diagnostic agent's text output and
                                   re-derive the structure. Two stages
                                   stop composing — they become parallel
                                   solvers of the same problem.

handoff carrier                    The pipeline can't run. In-process:
                                   no way to thread the return value
                                   through `start()`. Across requests:
                                   no way to carry the diagnosis to the
                                   recommend step at all — Split Steps
                                   becomes impossible.

the gate                           Combined Run: the next stage fires
                                   unsolicited on every diagnose, doubling
                                   spend even when the user didn't want a
                                   recommendation. Split Steps: the next
                                   stage never fires, because nothing
                                   tells the route which agent to run.
                                   "Deterministic orchestration" requires
                                   code making the decision; absence of
                                   the gate means *nothing* is making it.

per-stage tools + budget           Recommendation can call analytics
                                   tools meant for diagnostic; it
                                   re-investigates from scratch instead
                                   of using the handed-over Diagnosis.
                                   The "pass the typed message forward"
                                   gain evaporates. Budget compounds
                                   across stages with no isolation — one
                                   slow stage burns the next stage's
                                   allotment too.
```

The kernel composes: the typed message *carries* the work forward, the carrier *moves* it across the boundary, the gate *decides* what runs next, and per-stage isolation *protects* one stage from another's spend. Drop any one and the pipeline reverts to "uncoordinated agents in sequence."

---

### Separate skeleton from optional hardening

The kernel is the minimum that makes this a pipeline. Everything around it is hardening — useful, but layered on. The interesting move is that *two of the hardening choices coexist*: the codebase ships *both* carriers, because the same pipeline runs in two modes.

```

                                            └ parallel fan-out across peer
                                                stages (ABSENT — stages are
                                                inherently sequential here;
                                                see `04-parallel-fan-out.md`)
```

The takeaway is **the pipeline is one shape with two carriers.** In-process: a function call (`const dx = await diagAgent.investigate(...); await recAgent.propose(inv, dx, ...)`). Across requests: a `sessionStorage` write plus a URL-param read. The *typed message* — `Diagnosis` — is the invariant. The carrier is hardening that varies by mode.

This is what people mean by "agents as pipeline stages": agents that ship typed messages between themselves the way functions ship typed return values, with code owning the order.


The full picture is below.

## Implementation in codebase

**Case A — the pipeline is the primary topology.**

**The pipeline order (code owns it)**
**File:** `app/api/agent/route.ts`
**Function / class:** `GET` stream `start()` body
**Line range:** L224–L249 — STEP 2 diagnose (L231–L240), STEP 3 recommend (L244–L249), inter-stage handoff via `diagnosis` (L238, L247)

**The typed inter-stage message**
**File:** `lib/mcp/types.ts`
**Function / class:** `interface Diagnosis`
**Line range:** L95–L104

**The cross-request handoff (client side)**
**File:** `lib/hooks/useInvestigation.ts`
**Function / class:** the `case 'done':` block of the SSE handler
**Line range:** L138 (write) — `sessionStorage.setItem(diagHandoffKey(id), JSON.stringify({ diagnosis: cDiag }))`

**The cross-request handoff (server side)**
**File:** `app/api/agent/route.ts`
**Function / class:** `parseDiagnosis()`
**Line range:** L86–L97 — validates that the handed-over object has `conclusion`, `evidence[]`, `hypothesesConsidered[]` before resuming the pipeline

**Per-stage budgets (the per-stage "size" of each pipeline link)**
**File:** `lib/agents/diagnostic.ts` L62 (`maxToolCalls: 6`), `lib/agents/recommendation.ts` L57 (`maxToolCalls: 4`), `lib/agents/monitoring.ts` L101 (`maxToolCalls: 6`)

**Demo replay filter (the same pipeline, sliced by step)**
**File:** `app/api/agent/route.ts`
**Function / class:** `filterByStep()`
**Line range:** L66–L84 — the cached combined run is filtered to just `diagnose` or just `recommend` events for replay

## Elaborate

### Where this pattern comes from

Sequential pipelines pre-date LLMs by decades — every Unix pipeline (`ps | grep | awk`) is one. The LLM-pipeline version got its current framing from Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" (2024), which named "prompt chaining" as the simplest agentic workflow: decompose a task into a fixed sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. The essay's key insight: when latency is acceptable and accuracy matters, decomposing into a chain trades a single complex prompt for several focused ones — and focused prompts measurably outperform combined ones.

### The deeper principle

**Pipelines work when the data dependency is sequential and the order is knowable.** Both halves matter. If the data dependency is sequential but the order isn't knowable (one stage might be skipped, another repeated), you need a state machine or a supervisor. If the order is knowable but the data dependency isn't sequential (sub-jobs are independent), you should fan out in parallel.

```
   sequential data dep + knowable order   → pipeline
   sequential data dep + unknowable order → supervisor / state machine
   independent sub-jobs + any order        → parallel fan-out
   peer interaction with no fixed order    → swarm / handoff
```

The pipeline isn't a compromise — it's the right shape when both conditions hold, and only when both conditions hold.

### Where this breaks down

The pipeline breaks when the data dependency starts to branch — e.g. when "the diagnosis might be inconclusive, so re-run with a deeper budget" introduces a back-edge that an `if`-ladder can express but a more complex branching pattern can't. At that point you're in graph orchestration (`./07-graph-orchestration.md`) territory.

It also breaks when latency becomes the constraint — a pipeline's latency is the *sum* of all stages, with no parallelism. If two stages don't actually depend on each other, running them in parallel (fan-out, `./04-parallel-fan-out.md`) is cheaper.

### What to explore next
- `./04-parallel-fan-out.md` → what the pipeline becomes when sub-jobs are independent
- `./08-shared-state-and-message-passing.md` → the typed `Diagnosis` is the message-passing version of inter-stage communication
- `./07-graph-orchestration.md` → pipelines expressed as state graphs with checkpointing and conditional edges
- `../../study-system-design-dsa/01-system-design/07-client-stream-handoff.md` → the cross-request handoff via `sessionStorage` from a system-design perspective

## Interview defense

### What an interviewer is really asking

When an interviewer asks "why a pipeline" they're testing whether you can defend a *sequential* design under pressure — whether you chose it because the work was sequential, or because you didn't reach for parallelism. The strong signal is naming the data dependency that forces sequential (the recommendation agent's signature takes the diagnosis as an arg). The weak signal is calling pipelines "simpler" without naming the constraint that made simpler enough.

### Likely questions

[mid] Q: What's the inter-stage message in blooming insights?

A: The typed `Diagnosis` object defined in `lib/mcp/types.ts` L95–L104 — it has `conclusion`, `evidence[]`, `hypothesesConsidered[]`, optional `affectedCustomers`, `confidence`, and `timeSeries`. The diagnostic agent returns it, the recommendation agent takes it as the second argument to `propose(anomaly, diagnosis, hooks)`. In the split-step UX it's persisted to `sessionStorage` with key `bi:diag:<id>` between step 2 and step 3.

Diagram:
```
  diagnostic agent              recommendation agent
   investigate()    ──Diagnosis──►   propose(_, diagnosis, _)
                       (typed)

  cross-request:
   sessionStorage.setItem('bi:diag:<id>', JSON.stringify({diagnosis}))
   then ?diagnosis=… in the next request URL
   → parseDiagnosis() validates the shape before resuming
```

[senior] Q: Why didn't you fan these out in parallel?

A: Because the data dependency is real — `RecommendationAgent.propose(anomaly, diagnosis, hooks)` literally takes the diagnosis as its second arg. There's no way to start the recommendation stage before the diagnostic stage completes; the recommendation agent's prompt references `diagnosis.conclusion` and iterates over `diagnosis.evidence[]`. Parallelizing them would mean running recommendation with no input — wasted work I'd throw away. The constraint forcing sequential is the data flow, not preference.

Diagram:
```
  What the signatures say:

  diagAgent.investigate(anomaly): Promise<Diagnosis>
                                       │
                                       ▼
  recAgent.propose(anomaly, diagnosis, hooks): Promise<Recommendation[]>
                            ▲
                            └── this argument forces the order
```

[arch] Q: At 10x anomaly volume, what's the first thing that breaks in the pipeline?

A: Wall-clock latency, not throughput. Per investigation, the pipeline is ~5–15s (diagnostic) + ~3–8s (recommendation), all sequential under the shared ~1 req/s MCP rate limit (`connect.ts` L92). At 10x volume, more concurrent investigations means more concurrent agent loops competing for the same MCP throughput, not faster individual investigations. The fix is fan-out backpressure (concurrency limiter on the agent layer, see `../05-production-serving/02-fan-out-backpressure.md`) and cross-run caching of repeated EQL sub-steps inside each stage. The pipeline shape itself doesn't change — the bottleneck is at the serving layer.

Diagram:
```
  ┌ Route layer (if-ladder) ──── fine, stateless ─────┐
  ┌ Agent layer (4 ReAct loops) ◄─ contention: 10x    │
  │                                investigations share │
  │                                ~1 req/s MCP budget  │
  ┌ MCP layer (~1 req/s) ◄────────── shared bottleneck │
  │                                                     │
  add: fan-out backpressure + cross-run cache here     │
```

### The question candidates always dodge

Q: If the pipeline is sequential, isn't this just "three chained API calls" — why call it multi-agent at all?

A: Because the unit of work between the chained calls is *not* a single LLM call — it's a full ReAct loop with its own tool budget, its own iteration cap, and its own forced-final-turn behavior. The diagnostic agent runs 3–7 turns of `tool_use` + observation before producing the `Diagnosis`; the recommendation agent runs 2–4 turns before producing recommendations. Each link in the chain is itself an autonomous loop. The reason "three chained API calls" understates it is that those three "calls" are non-deterministic in length, variable in tool selection, and each one writes its own internal trajectory. The chain is one shape; the inside of each link is another shape. The accurate framing is "a chain *of agents*" — and naming the outer shape "pipeline" doesn't downgrade the inner shape from "agent" to "call." Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" deliberately separates "workflow" (the outer shape) from "agent" (the inner shape) because they're orthogonal — you can have a workflow of agents, and that's exactly what this is.

Diagram:
```
  Outer shape: pipeline (sequential, code-owned order)

  ┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐
  │  Stage A │ ─Diag─► │  Stage B │ ─Recs─► │ Client   │
  └──────────┘         └──────────┘         └──────────┘
       │                     │
       │ zoom into one stage │
       ▼                     ▼
  Inner shape: ReAct LOOP (variable length, model-driven)

   reason → tool → observe → reason → tool → observe → … → final

   chain of agents ≠ chain of calls
```

### One-line anchors

- "The pipeline order is fixed because the data flow is sequential — `propose(_, diagnosis, _)` requires the diagnosis as an argument."
- "Each stage has its own prompt, its own tool subset, and its own budget — focus by separation, not by prompt cleverness."
- "The typed `Diagnosis` is the message; it survives in-process as a function arg and cross-request as a `sessionStorage` value."
- "It's a chain of agents — the outer shape is sequential, the inner shape is a ReAct loop. Naming the outer 'pipeline' doesn't downgrade the inner from 'agent' to 'call.'"

## Validate your understanding

### Level 1 — Reconstruct the diagram

Close this file. Draw the sequential pipeline from memory: three boxes (monitoring → diagnostic → recommendation), arrows between them labelled with the message type (Anomaly → Diagnosis → Recommendations). Then add a second layer below the diagnostic box showing the ReAct loop inside one stage.

Open the file. Compare.

✓ Pass: you drew three stages, labelled the inter-stage messages (especially Diagnosis), and showed the ReAct loop inside one stage
✗ Fail: re-read How it works Layer 1 and the diagram section, wait 10 minutes, try again.

### Level 2 — Explain it out loud

Explain the pipeline to a colleague who asked "why isn't this all one agent?" — under 90 seconds, no notes.

Checkpoints — did you:
- Name `app/api/agent/route.ts` L224–L249 (the code that owns the order)?
- Name the inter-stage message (`Diagnosis` in `lib/mcp/types.ts`)?
- Say why the order is sequential (data dependency: recommendation needs diagnosis)?
- Name the per-stage budgets (6/6/4) and why they matter (tool budget contention)?

If you skipped any: you described the pipeline, you didn't defend it.

### Level 3 — Apply it to a new scenario

A product manager proposes: "Add a fourth stage — `summary` — that runs after recommendation and produces a one-paragraph summary the user can copy-paste into Slack." The summary needs the diagnosis AND the recommendations as input.

Without looking at the file: where would `summary` slot into the pipeline? What new type would you add to `lib/mcp/types.ts`? Which line range of `route.ts` would change, and how does the in-process / cross-request handoff change?

Write your answer (3–5 sentences). Then open `app/api/agent/route.ts` L244–L249 and check whether the change is a straightforward extension or whether the cross-request handoff (now with two messages — diagnosis AND recommendations) is the load-bearing complication.

### Level 4 — Defend the decision you'd change

"If you were building this today with the same problem (anomaly → diagnose → recommend) but with a hard 5-second total latency budget, would you still use a sequential pipeline? Why or why not? If you'd switch to a different topology, which one (parallel fan-out? mega-agent?), and how would you handle the recommendation agent's data dependency on the diagnosis?"

Reference the code: `route.ts` L237–L248 (the in-process pipeline), `recommendation.ts:propose(anomaly, diagnosis, hooks)` signature, `connect.ts` L92 (the ~1.1s MCP spacing that bounds per-stage latency).

### Quick check — code reference test

Without opening any files:
- What file defines the inter-stage message type?
- What's the key the client uses to persist the diagnosis between step 2 and step 3?
- What function validates the handed-over diagnosis when step 3 starts?

Open and verify. ✓ File + function names matter; line numbers drifting is fine.
